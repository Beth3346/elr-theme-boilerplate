This is a basic wordpress theme structure for creating new wordpress themes.

== Description ==

This basic theme contains all basic wordpress files. I still have a lot of work to do to get it ready.

== Installation ==

1. Create any color scheme stylesheets by making a copy of color-scheme.scss. CSS files should go in the styles folder so that the Theme Options plugin can detect them
2. Upload `elr-theme-boilerplate.zip` to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
3. Activate the theme in WordPress
4. Install all required plugins
